Q3

Thank you for reaching out
I am not afraid of Human Resources
And I’m not afraid to tell you
How I feel

I was wondering if you’ve had a chance
To read the document I shared
If not that’s OK
About the family of bears preparing for winter
If you could e-sign by EOW that’d be great

Let me know if you have
Any questions
Like
“What happened to us?”

Q3 always reminds me
I could have lived my life all different
Someday I just might
