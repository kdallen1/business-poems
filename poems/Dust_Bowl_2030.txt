Dust Bowl 2030

Down on the farm
We grow, extract, distill
Raw data into something real
Something with columns and rows
Rows and rows as far as the eye can see
Turning the honest ground
We turn dreams into csv

Out in California
They invented something
Called “procedural dreaming”
You put a special hat on a type of robot
That’s never worked a day in his life
Then tesseracts bloom under polygon sun and
Sublimate straight into spreadsheets

Do they understand a man
Can make his heart explode?
