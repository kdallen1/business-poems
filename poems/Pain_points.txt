Pain points

Can’t you feel my pain points
Don’t you understand
I’m just a man
With a mouth for a cave and a gun
I laid track straight for miles
Until I arrived here
Right now
At the mouth of the cave
And I realized I could go no further

You were born into this wreck aware
Something happened here right now
Something is happening one second into the future
Deep inside the cave
We never could have seen this coming
Whatever it is

You are on the edge of legibility now
Would you care to follow up
Tell me it doesn’t have to end like this
I’ll learn to be a man with a mouth
For a cave and a light
