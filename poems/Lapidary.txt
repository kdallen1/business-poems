Lapidary

Day in day out
Hot rock cool rock
Night sun eats light
Like glass then blood
You can trust
The lapping waves
I am digging something
It is not a grave
It is as dark as one till
You let your eyes adjust
Look, you can see the stars
Kneel, touch carved stone
To your lips, taste sea foam till
Your spit tastes acidic and sweet
Like muscadine grapes
Or honeysuckle, one or the other
Something I ate wild off the vine
When I was young
