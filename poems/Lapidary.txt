Lapidary

Day in day out
Hot rock cool rock
Carving a heart out of stone
Takes so many sunsets
And so much blood
But you trust
The lapping waves
I am digging something
It is not a grave
It is as dark as one till
You let your eyes adjust
From here you can see the stars
Kneel, touch carved stone
To your lips, taste sea foam till
Your spit tastes acidic and sweet
Like muscadine grapes
Or honeysuckle, one or the other
Something I ate wild off the vine
When I was young
