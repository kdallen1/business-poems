Mountain

One day the mountain wakes up
Finds time
To grow a coat of trees
To bend with heavy eyries
To give the birds a place to rest

One day the mountain stops growing
Still God-licked
Still eroding
Still shrinking rock by rock
Year over year never knew
Nothing for certain except
You have to run as fast as you can
