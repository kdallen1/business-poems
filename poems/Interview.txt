Interview

Tell us about your last position
Were you fortuitous in battle
Did Heavenâ€™s fire light your path?

Did you ever etch into stone tablets
KPIs for the MVP
Or publish epistles with stretch goals?

Did you ever on corporate raids
Take work wives as war brides
And onboard them?

Tell us about a time you faced
Certain death, eternal glory
Then tell us why
We should still hire you
