Upcreek

Find the fuzzy gospel truth
Upcreek some old earthbrain
Would you believe me if I told you
We’re returning to the source?
You are far away as God
And we are far away as skin
As living fools we are
Water touching rock
Touching patient rock
Person-bits in abacus
Hand in hand in hand in
Believe in me like you believe in
Rock and water levels

Terrain flows from the fountain and the fountain
from terrain and both of these are made of words
Already enough to carry you back home
