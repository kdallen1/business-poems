How to supercharge your personal life using lean startup principles

Reduce churn: buy your girl flowers
Reduce spend: buy beer in 24-packs
Do things that don’t scale, like
Get a dumb ass job delivering food
Just so you can pay the AWS bill
Just so you can save up a little money
And purchase a rapidly depreciating asset
And when she tells you she isn’t interested
In entering into a multi-year agreement
Move fast and break everything in your house
Tell her in your exit interview
She’ll never find a disruptor like you
Raise a round from Mom and Dad
