Risk

Adding rows to a spreadsheet
Insulates us against unexpected events
Such as what if
The sun births a sky god that
Wipes all the datacenters and
Rains down fire which
Drives us underground
What if you attempt to assess the abyss
At the end of the risk assessment spreadsheet
What if during the team-building exercise
At the subterraneous off-site
When you are building a machine
Capable of destroying everything
Such as a Rube Goldberg machine
What if the marble doesnâ€™t stop?
