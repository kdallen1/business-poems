Risk

Adding rows to a spreadsheet
Insulates us against unexpected events
e.g. the sun births a sky god who
Wipes all the datacenters and
Rains down fire which
Drives us underground
When you attempt to assess the abyss
At the end of the risk assessment spreadsheet

During the team-building exercise
At the subterraneous off-site
When you are building a machine
Capable of destroying everything
e.g. a Rube Goldberg machine
You have to pause and ask yourself
What if the marble doesnâ€™t stop?
