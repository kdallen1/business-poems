Scroll

You don’t have to live like this
I can see your screen
Your whole lunch break
There’s something I want to show you
While you’re sitting in your car
Can you scroll down?
Dreaming 
A little more
About another life
Keep scrolling
Realize that nothing is stopping you
Keep scrolling
You can do whatever you want
Right here
You can live in the trees
You passed it
The last human to live a completely arboreal existence
Now up a little
Wasn’t that long ago
