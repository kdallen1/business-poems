Doing Business As

I’m doing business as the wandering prophet
I’m staying at an Airbnb
The house rules say,
Do Your Business Elsewhere

I’m doing business as the first time
My parents’ eyes met
Look Mom! I’m doing business
For the whole world to see

I’m doing business as Father Time
The king of the mountain is
The market leader but
The market knows
He can’t live forever
Not in this economy
