Heaven

You can say what Heaven is
Go on: say Heaven is
A tube with no end
And no beginning

Say Heaven is
A series of tubes
We built to hold more God
Once the world had finished growing
Once its marrow kept expanding and
Burst out like biscuit dough

Sing Hallelujah:
Your bones are all shattered and
Heaven cannot be contained
