Birthday cake

My brain is a birthday cake
You dropped on the floor
It’s not even my birthday cake
It’s for all the November birthdays

You get paid the same
Even if you drop a cake
In front of everyone
Including God

Out by the loading dock
A big ladder goes up
To a hatch
It’s never locked
Have you been up there before?
You can see everything
