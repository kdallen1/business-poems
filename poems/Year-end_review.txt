Year-end review

The council is reviewing your performance
The council is requesting that
You review your own performance
Catalog every occasion you had a vision

The council is rethinking your compensation package
The council is thinking birdsong
There are things that are better than money
There are things that sound like money

The council feels you could really move the needle
There are whispers in the break room
About a great disruptor
The council is consulting
The Bayâ€™s crustiest cnidarians
The council has to know for sure
The council has to know for certain
