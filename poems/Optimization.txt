Optimization

There’s a hole in the global economy
In a cave at the top of the mountain
The hole is shaped just like you
Not you as you are
But you once you’ve climbed
To the cave at the top of the mountain

You just have to be directionally
Correct each day
And it compounds, you see
Like an increase in elevation
Like your heart beating faster
Like realizing how far you are from home

When you descend into heaven expect
No remuneration except all the lights
Off and a slideshow of you inside a cave
