Let me share my screen

Let me share my screen
With the downtrodden, the lost, the forlorn
Let me share my screen with those who have never known salvation

Those who never saw their reflection
In a Powerpoint template
Those who never lingered on a call after everyone's gone
Changed their background to the beach
Wondered if corporate might buy you a lounging desk

Let me share my screen
In Jesus' name
Amen
