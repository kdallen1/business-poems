Platonic

The shape Iâ€™m in since
saccades crossed cicadas since
all shapes cast spells since
you are a shape, and so am I,
my hand grasps at your hand
your hand grasps at an ant cairn
and touches nothing since
a plane flies between
the sun and you and me and we
blink out of existence
for the first time since
the Great Southern Brood
emerged from
the ground in the shape of us
