Milestone

We are celebrating a milestone
We quarried it from miles away
New hires will wonder
How we accomplished something so
Monumental

New hiresâ€™ new hires will
Paint our runes on whiteboards
And hypothesize how stone circuits
Pumped semiotic fluid

We are celebrating a milestone
The CEO steps down
And lies upon the altar
The board wishes him well
In his new position
