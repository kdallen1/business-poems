Transmission #2

There’s still time
For you to learn
The things that rivers do
Like flowing up oneself
When the ground shakes
Like running into the sea

There’s still time
If you act now
Since time is gasoline
Until it’s fire
Our shed is full of coffee cans
We’d love to hear your opinion

Every night we see the sky
We see your eyes reflecting fire
A bird made of sun whose name is the moon
And we’d still love to hear from you
