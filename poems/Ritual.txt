Ritual

Good morning everyone
Give us this day our daily stand-up
Th’ workday’s over so soon
Meeting moments become meeting minutes

In the black or in the red
All I see are blue skies baby
Our balance sheet
Is the global economy
Experiencing itself subjectively

There is no such thing as bankruptcy—
Think about it—
The money’s got to go somewhere
