Company culture

In the official imagination
Sun dogs run laps around the data lake
Engineers fuzz test the new version of absolution
Stakeholders perform a bake-off between
Every type of enlightenment we can find
We’ll white-label one and offer it to our customers
Back in the old times they used to say
“It costs nothing to dream”
Now we know a dream can cost your whole life
That’s why we’re building a solution
That will enable dreamers
To dream 10x faster
So they can get back to what matters
The great work
