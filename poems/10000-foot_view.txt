10,000-foot view

From the 10,000-foot view
Our friends appear like little ants
Do you think they will remember us?
When we come down

From this perspective
We could tear down the sky
Trace it back to breath or song
Through algae to old yowls

From this perspective
We could give birds no meaning
Let terns sail their own sighs
Sputter softly to the sea

We should have shoveled up their barrows!
Into subterrariums and released
Golden ants swarming clouds
Like liquid sun in filigree

Do you think they will remember us?
As nascent constellations
We're just here for a little while
And they were deep in song

Keep on working hard my babies
Keep on working hard my friends
We will meet you at the bottom
To build blue skies again
