Attention apocalypse shoppers
The time is now
Two minutes to midnight
Please take all that you can bear
And make your way to the gates of that
Beautiful city

Make me whole, no, make me part
Make my face my face reflected in
The fractal of my God, what have I become?
Another seedling ghost of the godhead
Emerging in facsimile
We have the technology to make
Everything you see a screen to make
Angels of us all
