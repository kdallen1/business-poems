Tony Hawk

Where were you when Tony Hawk
landed the 900
million dollar
licensing deal frontside heelflip

I was floating
All my bones were gone away
From the ten thousand foot view
I could see everyone
Grinding
Creating solutions that
Inspire growth
And it feels so essential when you’re in it
Feels like it’s all there is
