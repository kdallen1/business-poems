Blackshirts

We should have listened to the men in black shirts
Who foresaw before and
Before the river jangled
The great exodus of capital
From the stock market
To the bond market
To the oceans white with foam

We should have listened to the men in black shirts
Who knew the market
Used to be a boy and every time
You make a transaction
The boy can feel it and it hurts him

We should have listened to the canyon wren
A distinctive pot-bellied wren with decurved bill
Whose song some say sounds like
Hold on baby, donâ€™t panic, when this is all over
Everybody gets a garden
Everybody gets a truck
