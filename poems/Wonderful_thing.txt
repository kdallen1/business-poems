Wonderful thing

If there ever was a wonderful thing
I’d send a message
to you with
all your friends in cc
Saying sorry for the delay
Please look out the window now

If one honest thing ever came across my desk
I’d send a gentle reminder
To the bird inside your chest
Fluttering and charismatic
Yearning for sky
