Raising

I’m raising one million dollars
A humble seed round for
To grow my crops, to buy some fertilizer, and to fix my tractor
Soon I will ride
Into town, brandishing my pistols
Hootin’ / hollerin’
Raising Hell

I’m raising fifty million dollars
For an exciting new project
I just need some money for the bus,
A standing desk, and a few H100’s
We’re going to cure the blues
Using linear algebra

I’m raising one billion dollars
To solve untangling
If we invent God
In the process
It will have been out of necessity
