Myrmecochory

First thing in the morning
I told you about a blog post
I read about the coming Cambrian
Explosion of corporate forms
You didn’t like that one bit

Not because you don’t want me to be
Teleost fishes reaching the beaches
I think you do
But because you want to be ants
And what does that say about us?

Once I was a dropped popsicle puddle
Sungazing I would have been
Perfect for you

Now did you ever consider that ants
And trees have an economy you don’t
Get to participate in or
Know what it means
To work your way up from the forest floor

We call it myrmecochory but
They don’t call it anything

At the end of the day
We collect like rain
Effortlessly
And you don’t say anything about how
Isn’t it funny that we ended up here
Still calling ourselves rain
