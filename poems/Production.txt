Production

Are you searching for the truth? No
I am searching for new opportunities
I am producing outcomes I am passionate
About producing outcomes
I cannot stop things from happening
At the enterprise level
Like a diluvian sunrise
Like a baby calf in the Kali Yuga
I’m going to leverage I’m going to
Leverage I’m leveraging
I cannot stop the ground
From leaving my feet
At the end of days
At the end of the day
There’s a red button
Someone will press it
For us it’s a good thing
Net-net it’s a win
