Gentle reminder

This is a gentle reminder
The all hands is mandatory
The org chart is not the department
And Gabriella if you ever so much as
Blink so as to deny me a moment
Which I can't get back and neither will you
For to gaze into your big eyes the color of
Dirt stomped worms I swear to god I will
absolutely make you regret ever letting me
into your life baby
