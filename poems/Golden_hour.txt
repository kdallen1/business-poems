Golden hour

Vaguely gesture at the golden hour
Like you’ve seen this one before
It looks like a PowerPoint presentation
Gradient you say like something I made
In the third grade
You talk miracles
Like they’re eating sno-cones on the beach
Making sense to one another
We walk the plank preciously with
The flowing warmth below
High above experience
It doesn’t have to be so serious
You say floating a millimeter
Off the ground
