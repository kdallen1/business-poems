Golden hour

Vaguely gesture at the golden hour
Like you’ve seen this one before
It looks like a PowerPoint presentation
Gradient you say like something I made
In the third grade
You talk miracles
Like they’re eating sno-cones on the beach
When making sense we walk the plank
The warm flow of experience below
It doesn’t have to be so serious
You say floating a millimeter or so
Off the ground
