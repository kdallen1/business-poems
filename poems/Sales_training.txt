Sales training

Become the cold blooded
Sales machine you were born to be
That legend foretold

You have to be ice cold
If you show weakness they will
Eat you like wolves
If you fall in love you will be fired

Understanding the user
Understanding the userâ€™s pain points
The way she legitimately seemed
Happy to see you
The fluid dynamics of her hair

Go take what is yours
The Midwest territory
If you remember her sweetly
During business hours
You will be put on a PIP
